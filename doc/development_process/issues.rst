Bug Reporting and Feature Tracking
###################################

To maintain traceability and relation between proposals, changes, features, and
issues, cross-referencing a commit with a GitHub Issue and vice versa should be
done. Any changes that originate from a tracked feature or issue should contain
a reference to the feature by mentioning the corresponding Issue or pull-request id.

At any time it should be possible to establish the origin of a change and the
reason behind it by following the references in the code.
